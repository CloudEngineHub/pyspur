### **Library**

A repository for both prompts and JSON schemas

---

### **Product Requirements Document (PRD) Outline**

#### **1. Introduction**
- **Overview:**
  Introduce the new feature to store and manage reusable AI prompts and JSON schemas. This enhancement is designed to save users time by eliminating the need to redefine these elements repeatedly in the visual drag-and-drop workflow builder.

- **Objective:**
  To provide a seamless, persistent library where users can save, manage, and reuse prompts and JSON schemas across projects.

#### **2. User Stories & Use Cases**
- **User Story 1:**
  *As a workflow creator, I want to save my frequently used prompts and JSON schemas so that I can quickly reuse them in new workflows without having to recreate them every time.*

- **User Story 2:**
  *As a team member, I want to share my saved prompts/schemas with colleagues to ensure consistency and efficiency across collaborative projects.*

- **User Story 3:**
  *As an advanced user, I want to categorize and tag my saved items for easy search and retrieval.*

#### **3. Functional Requirements**
- **Saving & Retrieval:**
  - Ability to **save** a prompt or JSON schema to the library.
  - Support for **persistent storage** so that items are available across sessions.
  - **Edit** and **delete** functionalities for saved items.

- **Organization & Categorization:**
  - Options to **tag**, **categorize**, or **label** each saved item.
  - Ability to create **folders or collections** for organizing items.

- **Search & Filter:**
  - A **search bar** to quickly find items by name, tag, or description.
  - **Filtering options** (e.g., by date, type, or category).

- **Versioning & History:**
  - **Version control** for saved items to track changes and allow rollback if needed.

- **Integration:**
  - **Seamless integration** with the existing drag-and-drop interface.
  - Ability to **drag-and-drop** items from the library into workflows.

- **Sharing & Collaboration:**
  - Options to **share** items with other users or teams.
  - **Access control** to set permissions (view, edit, delete) for shared items.

- **Import/Export:**
  - Ability to **export** saved items (e.g., as JSON files) for backup or transfer.
  - Option to **import** items from external sources or previous sessions.

- **Validation & Preview:**
  - Built-in **preview** and **validation** for JSON schemas.
  - Real-time **syntax checking** for prompts to avoid errors in workflows.

#### **4. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Performance:**
  - The library should load quickly, even with a large number of saved items.

- **Scalability:**
  - Must handle a growing number of items without degrading performance.

- **Security:**
  - Ensure **data security** and **user privacy** for saved prompts and schemas.
  - **Role-based access** for shared libraries.

- **Usability:**
  - The interface should be intuitive and integrate naturally with the existing workflow builder.
  - **Responsive design** for use across different devices.

#### **5. User Interface & UX Considerations**
- **Dashboard Integration:**
  - A dedicated tab or sidebar in the workflow builder for quick access to the library.

- **Item Cards/List View:**
  - Display saved items as cards or in a list with details (name, description, tags, date modified).

- **Context Menus:**
  - Right-click or action menus for editing, deleting, or sharing items.

- **Drag-and-Drop Interaction:**
  - Ensure smooth drag-and-drop behavior from the library into the workflow canvas.

- **Notifications:**
  - Provide user feedback for actions (e.g., “Prompt saved successfully”, “Item deleted”).

#### **6. API & Integration Considerations**
- **API Endpoints:**
  - Create endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for prompts and JSON schemas.

- **Documentation:**
  - Provide API documentation for developers who want to integrate or extend the library’s functionality.

#### **7. Dependencies & Risks**
- **Dependencies:**
  - Integration with the existing workflow engine.
  - Backend data storage and version control system.

- **Risks:**
  - Potential for data loss if versioning is not implemented correctly.
  - Performance issues with a large volume of items.
  - Security risks in sharing sensitive prompts/schemas.

#### **8. Future Enhancements**
- **Analytics:**
  - Track usage metrics for saved items to understand which prompts/schemas are most popular.

- **Templates & Recommendations:**
  - Suggest templates based on frequently used items or user behavior.

- **Integration with External Libraries:**
  - Allow integration with third-party prompt libraries or schema validation tools.
