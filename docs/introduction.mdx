# Three Design Principles

## 1. Rapid Feedback Loops

* **Build and test in one place**: Run the workflow within the canvas editor and observe each node's outputs to get instant feedback.
* **Drag-and-drop**: Add new nodes that *just* work off-the-shelf within seconds.
* **Vendor unification**: Instead of 20 nodes for 20 vendors, unified nodes enable you to jump between eg. models quickly to see which one is best for your use case.

## 2. AI-Native

Unlike traditional workflow platforms, PySpur is AI-Native and comes with batteries included.

* **RAG**: Parse, chunk, embed, upsert data and maintain vector indices.
* **Loops**: Workflow graphs can include cycles for iterative tool calling.
* **Evals**: Score the performance of your agents to improve their robustness.
* **Tools**: >10 Popular integrations available as tools, with more to come.
* **Multimodal**: Support for video, images, audio, texts, code.

## 3. Easy Extensibility

Create custom nodes with a simple Python decorator:

```python
@NodeRegistry.register(
    category="Integrations",
    display_name="Firecrawl Scrape",
    logo="/images/firecrawl.png"
)
class FirecrawlScrapeNode(BaseNode):
    name = "firecrawl_scrape_node"
    config_model = FirecrawlScrapeNodeConfig
    input_model = FirecrawlScrapeNodeInput
    output_model = FirecrawlScrapeNodeOutput
    category = "Firecrawl"  # This will be used by the frontend for subcategory grouping

    async def run(self, input: BaseModel) -> BaseModel:
        """
        Scrapes a URL and returns the content in markdown or structured format.
        """
        pass
```

## Setting up

The first step to documentation is setting up your editing environments.
