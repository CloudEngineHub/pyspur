# PySpur's Design Principles

Pyspur encompasses three design principles:

## 1. Rapid feedback loops:

* **Build and test in one place:** Build and test your workflow in real-time within the canvas editor, providing you with instant feedback on your changes.
* **Vendor abstraction**: Not 20 different nodes for 20 different vendors. For example, a unified LLM call node that is vendor-agnostic, enabling you to jump between models quickly to see which one is best for your use case.

## 2. Built-In AI components

As AI capabilities improve, agentic workflows involve more AI-native components. For example:
* Larger context windows enabled *multi-document RAG*
* Reasoning models enabled robust *tool calling*
* Vision models enabled *web browsing*

Unlike traditional workflow platforms that rely on external integrations, PySpur's batteries-included approach gives you more control. Example: you spot a problematic document chunk in your vector index during run time? You can delete it directly inside PySpur.

## 3. Easy Extensibility

Create custom nodes with a simple Python decorator:

```python
@NodeRegistry.register(
    category="Integrations",
    display_name="Firecrawl Scrape",
    logo="/images/firecrawl.png"
)
class FirecrawlScrapeNode(BaseNode):
    name = "firecrawl_scrape_node"
    config_model = FirecrawlScrapeNodeConfig
    input_model = FirecrawlScrapeNodeInput
    output_model = FirecrawlScrapeNodeOutput
    category = "Firecrawl"  # This will be used by the frontend for subcategory grouping

    async def run(self, input: BaseModel) -> BaseModel:
        """
        Scrapes a URL and returns the content in markdown or structured format.
        """

```

## Setting up

The first step to documentation is setting up your editing environments.
