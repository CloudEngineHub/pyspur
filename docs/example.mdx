Let's explore a practical example: a spur we use to summarize technical content and share it in Slack. Click the image above to view it in full size.

1) A router splits the flow based on the input type - either a blog post URL or research paper PDF.
2) Blog posts are scraped via FireCrawl and summarized using an LLM.
3) Research papers are converted to markdown with Gemini 2.0 and summarized by Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a more conversational style.
4) The routes merge, selecting whichever branch produced output.
5) Finally, the summary is posted to Slack.

Now, let's recreate that spur step-by-step.
