Let's explore a practical example: a spur we use to summarize technical content and share it in Slack. Click the image above to view a spur run in full size or click [here](/images/SlackSummarizer.json) to download the spur.

1) A router splits the flow based on the input - either a blog post URL or research paper PDF.
2) Blog posts are scraped via FireCrawl and summarized using an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
3) Research papers are converted to markdown with Gemini 2.0 and summarized by Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a more conversational style.
4) The routes merge, selecting whichever branch produced output.
5) Finally, the summary is posted to Slack.

# Step by Step Tutorial

Now, let's recreate that spur step by step.

## Input Node

Each new spur includes a default, non-deletable input node. Its variables define the data used within the spur.

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/2_dark.png" />

When deployed as an API, these variables define the endpoint's input schema.

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/3_dark.png" />

## Router Node

The router node splits the pipeline based on input type:

1) Extract information via web scraping or PDF-to-markdown conversion.
2) Summarize content according to different preferences.

The router directs data to routes based on defined conditions, evaluating each route in order until a match is found.
