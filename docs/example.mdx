Let's explore a practical example: a spur we use to summarize technical content and share it in Slack. Click the image above to view a spur run in full size or click [here](/images/SlackSummarizer.json) to download the spur.


# Overview

1) A router splits the flow based on the input - either a blog post URL or research paper PDF.
2) Blog posts are scraped via FireCrawl and summarized using an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
3) Research papers are converted to markdown with Gemini 2.0 and summarized by Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a more conversational style.
4) The routes merge, selecting whichever branch produced output.
5) Finally, the summary is posted to Slack.


# Step by Step Tutorial

Now, let's recreate that spur step by step.

## Input Node

Every new spur has exactly one input node. It will be there by default and can't be deleted.

Its input variables define the data that can be used inside the spur.

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/2_dark.png" />

When deploying a spur as API, those variables will define the endpoint's input schema.

## Router Node

Next, we want to split the pipeline into two branches depending on the input. Specifically, depending on the input type, we want to

1) extract the relevant information in different ways (either by web scraping or PDF-to-markdown conversion), and
2) summarize the content in different ways according to different preferences (more on this later).

The router node allows us to do so by directing input data to different routes based on conditional rules we define. Each route is evaluated in order until a match is found.
