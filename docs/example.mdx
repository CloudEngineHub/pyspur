# The spur in action

Let's explore a practical example: a spur we use to summarize technical content and share it in Slack. Click the image above to view a spur run in full size or click [here](/images/SlackSummarizer.json) to download the spur.

1) A router splits the flow based on the input - either a blog post URL or research paper PDF.
2) Blog posts are scraped via FireCrawl and summarized using an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
3) Research papers are converted to markdown with Gemini 2.0 and summarized by Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a more conversational style.
4) The routes merge, selecting whichever branch produced output.
5) Finally, the summary is posted to Slack.

# Step by Step Tutorial

Now, let's recreate that spur step by step.

## Input Node

Each new spur includes a default, non-deletable input node. Its variables define the data used within the spur.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/example_walkthrough/2_light.png" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/2_dark.png" />

When deployed as an API, these variables define the endpoint's input schema.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/example_walkthrough/3_light.png" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/3_dark.png" />

## Router Node

The router node splits the pipeline based on input type:

1) Extract information via web scraping or PDF-to-markdown conversion.
2) Summarize content according to different preferences.

The router directs data to routes based on defined conditions, evaluating each route in order until a match is found.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/example_walkthrough/4_light.png" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/4_dark.png" />

## Route 1: Summarizing blog post

First, we want to scrape the post's URL and turn it into markdown. For this, we use the [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) tool.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/example_walkthrough/5_light.gif" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/5_dark.gif" />

Now, we want to pass that markdown to an LLM and write a prompt that captures our taste of summaries.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/example_walkthrough/6_light.gif" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/example_walkthrough/6_dark.gif" />

A visual agent builder is invaluable here: define test cases (blog posts), run them, review outputs at each node, and iterate until the results meet expectations.
