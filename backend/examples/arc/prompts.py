STEP_1_GENERATE_CODE = """You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the inputs. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also an additional input without a known output (or possibly multiple additional inputs). Your task is to determine the transformation rule and implement it in code.

You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the transformation in code.

After your reasoning, write code in triple backticks (```python and then ```). You should write a function called `transform` which takes a single argument, the input grid as `list[list[int]]`, and returns the transformed grid (also as `list[list[int]]`). You should make sure that you implement a version of the transformation which works in general (for inputs which have the same properties as the example inputs and the additional input(s)).

Don't write tests in your python code, just output the `transform` function."""

<reasoning>
The outputs don't have the same shape as the inputs, and they don't appear to be somewhat edited copies of the input.

The inputs appear to consist of "noisy" segments which are either stacked on top of each other or side-by-side. In other words, they are either noisy columns or noisy rows. Each segment consists of exactly one color. These colors also appear in the output.

In two of the example inputs (inputs 2 and 3), there are horizontal segments (rows) which are stacked on top of each other. The outputs for these inputs are each single columns. The color of each cell in the output column is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the other example input (input 1), there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. The output for this input is a single row. The color of each cell in the output row is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the additional input, there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. This input matches the "noisy" segment pattern of the other inputs.

The transformation rule appears to be to identify the colors of the segments and then to stack them side-by-side if they are columns or on top of each other if they are rows.

My code will first need to determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments. Then, it will need to identify the colors of the segments and stack them side-by-side or on top of each other as appropriate.

How can I determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments? Inputs which consist of column segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal column of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the leftmost (or rightmost) column. Otherwise, the leftmost (or rightmost) segment wouldn't be contiguous. Similarly, inputs which consist of row segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal row of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the topmost (or bottommost) row.

So, to identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments, I can check if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color. If they do, then the input consists of column segments. Otherwise, the input consists of row segments.

I need to know the colors of the segments (in order). I know that the segments are contiguous. So, I can take any row/column which includes all of the segments and then deduplicate the colors in that row/column. The resulting list of colors will be the colors of the segments (in order). If the input consists of column segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of column segments, I want to look at any row. I'll use the top row. If the input consists of row segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of row segments, I want to look at any column. I'll use the left column.

I'll use numpy in the code to make it easier to work with the grid.

The code should:

- Identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments. This can be done by checking if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color.
- Identify the colors of the segments (in order). This can be done by looking at the top row if the input consists of column segments and by looking at the left column if the input consists of row segments.
- If the input is columns, return a single row where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment. If the input is rows, return a single column where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment.

I'll now write the code.
