# Case Study: ARC-AGI

* ARC-AGI is an AGI benchmark that consists of unique training and evaluation tasks. * Each task contains input-output examples. The puzzle-like inputs and outputs present a grid where each square can be one of ten colors. A grid can be any height or width between 1x1 and 30x30.

# Why this module

* The goal of this module is to guide the design of pyspur towards solving the ARC-AGI benchmark
* I will try to reproduce the results of other approaches here while using as many Pyspur modules as possible.
* If not possible, I will make new modules that we can later integrate into pyspur
* I will also push ARC-specific code that won't be relevant for other tasks/pyspur as a whole
